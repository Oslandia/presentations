<!-- Open source contributors do more than they should. QGIS as a reference project should find sustainable ways to rock!

QGIS - like Geoserver, Mapserver and all the great OSGEO project - do not have to prove any longer that they can do the job. We now have millions of users, with great expectations, growing budgets and growing communities. Still we lack funding for boring tasks : packaging, bugfixing, documentation, QA and marketing need some love.

What about changing minds and stop saying open source does not cost anything ? Could that solve this situation where countries having most users also have the less contributors ? This talk will take profit of real life examples of big corporations that decided to pivot their approach from "using open source" to "embrace Opensource".

Let's get out of our technical comfort zone and expose ourselves to enlarge our contributor's base.

This is a deeply optimistic talk looking right into the eyes of what we need to improve, as an opensource ecosystem !

todo : insert conference  logo*
    add slide grow community
    add slide about aeag experience and loss of active funders
    explain how to fund : talk before on lists / open or fund a QEP / Talk to dev before anything

### History of QGIS contribution

20020 - Gary Sherman releases 0.0.1

First contributors were benevolent.

Most started being paid between 1.6 (2010) and 2.0 (2014)

Funds for QGIS.org

---

but that's only a fraction of it 

### 26 Million dollars !!

![Estimated costs OpenHub](estimated_cost_2019-08-23.png)

let's say 20% of it was funded, 
5.6 Million dollars might reflect the real transactions 

(totally random estimate)

# How to improve this? 

---

# Sponsoring & donations

Funding meetings, bug fix sprints, grant applications, infrastructure

Spread the word, act in local chapters. Convince your boss. And the boss above him. 

---

### Local chapter / local QGIS user group

Create one

Get money from subscription

Use a part of it for sponsoring, grant application

Raise new contributors

# Certification programs

* certificate trainees 
  * fund QGIS.org (already 10k € and >500 certicate issues)
  * explain contributive model to trainees
  * get more contribution from training providers

# Support contracts (but fair ones)

---

# Demanders

"Please can you do this very simple thing for free, and before anything else?"

"It's a shame, 3 versions after that no one adressed this issue"

---

Energy can't be only on dev's side. 

Fight to find budgets.

Fight to resist bureaucratic rules

---

When explained, most people are marvelled of this model, but most think there is a big corp underneath (like Mozilla, Android)

Advertise it the OSGEO model. 

Make it serious and credible

IT. JUST. WORKS.

DO IT :)

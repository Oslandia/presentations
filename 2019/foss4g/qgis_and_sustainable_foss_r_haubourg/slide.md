<!-- Open source contributors do more than they should. QGIS as a reference project should find sustainable ways to rock!

QGIS - like Geoserver, Mapserver and all the great OSGEO project - do not have to prove any longer that they can do the job. We now have millions of users, with great expectations, growing budgets and growing communities. Still we lack funding for boring tasks : packaging, bugfixing, documentation, QA and marketing need some love.

What about changing minds and stop saying open source does not cost anything ? Could that solve this situation where countries having most users also have the less contributors ? This talk will take profit of real life examples of big corporations that decided to pivot their approach from "using open source" to "embrace Opensource".

Let's get out of our technical comfort zone and expose ourselves to enlarge our contributor's base.

This is a deeply optimistic talk looking right into the eyes of what we need to improve, as an opensource ecosystem !

but that's only a fraction of it 

### 26 Million dollars !!

![Estimated costs OpenHub](estimated_cost_2019-08-23.png)

let's say 20% of it was funded, 
5.6 Million dollars might reflect the real transactions 

(totally random estimate)

# You ?

---

### How many use QGIS? 


---

### How many know the actual roadmap of QGIS? 

(fixed schedule / 4 months releases / 1 month minor versions / 1 year LTR)

---

### How many test QGIS and report issues and feedback during freeze period? 

On your own real production use cases. 

---

### How many of you have been blocked by an unfixed bug


---

### How many have support contracts ? 

---

### How many have subsribed to a user group ?

---

### How many have tried to subscribe or sponsor QGIS.org? 

Sponsoring OSGEO chapter or local user group is a valid YES

---


### How many of you start courses explaining the economics of our contributive model ? 


---

### How many of you took a fraction of the proprietary support contracts amount into open source contribution 

(how many of you struggle to get back budgets, where buying licence is easier?)


---

# How to improve this? 

---

### Sponsoring & donations

Funding meetings, bug fix sprints, grant applications, infrastructure

Spread the word, act in local chapters. Convince your boss. And the boss above him. 

---

### Local chapter / local QGIS user group

---

Create one

Get money from subscriptions and events

---

Use a part of it for 

**sponsoring**

**grant application**

**Raise new contributors**


---

Make it fun !

---

Raise baby contributors

Energy can't be only on dev's side. 

Fight to find budgets.

Fight to resist bureaucratic rules

Out of your comfort zone?     Dare, try.

Most people are true supporters but 

most think there is a big corp underneath 

**Advertise the OSGEO model. **

Make it serious and credible

**IT. WORKS.**

**DO IT :)**

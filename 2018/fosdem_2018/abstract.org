#+TITLE: Bicycle-sharing stations: profiling and availability prediction
#+AUTHOR: Damien Garaud <damien.garaud@oslandia.com>, RaphaÃ«l Delhome <raphael.delhome@oslandia.com>

This presentation will show an exploratory data analysis about bicycle-sharing
stations in two french cities (Lyon and Bordeaux). Thanks to Open Data portals,
bicycle-sharing availability data are freely accessible. The main issue linked
to these data is to predict bicycle availability for each sharing station.

The talk will follow a classic data workflow:

+ get and format the data
+ explore and visualize
+ process and predict

After a short introduction to Luigi, a data pipeline Python library, the second
part will show how to cluster sharing stations starting from their hourly
availability profile. The clustering effort will be done with KMeans, one of
the most popular unsupervised Machine Learning models. Then, some features
engineering methods will be carried out in order to prepare the data for
availability prediction. As a consequence a short-term (/e.g./ one hour)
bicycle availability prediction will be proposed.

A word will be said about the set of Python libraries used in this project:
luigi, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, folium or xgboost.
